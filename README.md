## Final-Project
  - This build will read the temperature when you press a button, then it will display the temperature onto a LCD screen and depending on the temperature light up a red or blue LED


1. About the project - this is where you use your answers from Part 1 and include one of your videos of what it
does
2. List of materials
3. How to wire - include written instructions with visual aids
4. How to run your program - this should include steps written for beginners. Feel free to use screenshots here two
5. What does the code do - either add comments to your Python file in the repository already, or copy your code
into this Markdown file and add comments. These should explain your code.
6. Resources - you don't need to do a full citation, just the link and the title is fine.
