## Final-Project
  - This build will read the temperature when you press a button, then it will display the temperature onto a LCD screen and depending on the temperature light up a red or blue LED

# Materials
- LD 16x2 display
- Blue LED(5mm)
- Red LED(5mm)
- Tactile Buttle 
- DHT 11 temp/humidity
- MM jumper wires
- Resistors
- Bread Board
- PI

# How to Wire:
- Collect all supplies(shown above)
  - Wire blue and red LEDs using two MM jumper wires, one resistor, and the colored LED for each one:

3. How to wire - include written instructions with visual aids
4. How to run your program - this should include steps written for beginners. Feel free to use screenshots here two
5. What does the code do - either add comments to your Python file in the repository already, or copy your code
into this Markdown file and add comments. These should explain your code.
